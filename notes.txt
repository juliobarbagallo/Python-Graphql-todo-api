1) Create virtual env and activate it
2) Install packages
    pip install flask ariadne flask-sqlalchemy
3) Create graphql schema file: schema.graphql
4) Now we need to tell Flask where to find the app application instance. We do that by setting the environment variable FLASK_APP to the name of the top-level Python file that has the app, which in our case is main.py. Set it as follows:
    set FLASK_APP=main.py
